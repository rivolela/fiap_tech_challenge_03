# Tech Challenge 03 | FIAP 2024

## 1 - Objective: 

This project is part of an academic challenge at FIAP College, where I will develop an application for real estate investors in the Porto region of Portugal. The application will predict the average rent prices for the next 12 months using data from various official Portuguese sources. A machine learning model will be trained on the collected data, and the predictions will be delivered through a Streamlit application for investors' use.
